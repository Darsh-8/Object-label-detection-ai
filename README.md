## ‚≠ê Overview

DarshAI is an innovative open-source project that simplifies and automates the complex task of object and label detection in images using cutting-edge AI services. It provides a robust, web-based platform for intelligent image analysis and efficient data management.

> In today's data-rich world, manually categorizing and searching through vast collections of images is inefficient and error-prone. Businesses, researchers, and developers need a scalable, accurate, and automated solution to derive meaningful insights and structure from visual content.

DarshAI provides an elegant, web-based platform where users can effortlessly upload images, trigger intelligent AI analysis for object and label detection, and then efficiently search, retrieve, and manage their annotated image data. This transforms raw visual assets into structured, actionable information, drastically reducing manual effort and increasing data utility.

This project is built as a lightweight, Flask-based web application that serves as an intuitive interface for image management and AI interaction. It leverages `boto3` to interact seamlessly with core Amazon Web Services (AWS), including Amazon S3 for durable image storage and Amazon Rekognition for sophisticated object and label detection. Image metadata and analysis results are persistently stored, enabling robust search and management capabilities directly through the application.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Labeling:** Utilizes Amazon Rekognition to automatically identify objects, scenes, and activities within uploaded images, providing rich, descriptive labels for enhanced understanding and categorization.
*   **Secure & Scalable Image Storage:** Integrates seamlessly with Amazon S3, offering highly durable, scalable, and secure object storage for all uploaded visual assets, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
*   **Intuitive Web Interface:** Offers a simple and responsive web portal (built with `index.html`) for straightforward image uploads, browsing of labeled images, and overall application management.
*   **Advanced Search & Retrieval:** Enables users to efficiently search through stored images based on detected labels, keywords, and other metadata, making it easy to find specific visual content.
*   **Comprehensive Image Lifecycle Management:** Provides essential functionalities to manage stored images, including viewing detailed label analysis and performing secure deletions, directly from the application's interface.
*   **API Endpoints for Integration:** Exposes programmatic endpoints such as `/api/stats` for monitoring, and the backend functions (`search`, `delete`) hint at potential for wider integration or programmatic access to the system's capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

DarshAI is engineered with a focus on simplicity, scalability, and leveraging cloud-native services.

| Technology | Purpose | Why it was Chosen |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python 3.x | Primary Programming Language | For its versatility, extensive libraries, and strong community support, especially in AI and web development. |
| Flask | Web Framework | Chosen for its lightweight, flexible, and modular design, making it ideal for quickly building focused web applications. |
| Boto3 | AWS SDK for Python | Enables seamless and programmatic interaction with Amazon Web Services, crucial for integrating with S3 and Rekognition. |
| Amazon S3 | Object Storage Service | Provides highly scalable, durable, and secure object storage for all uploaded images, ensuring data integrity. |
| Amazon Rekognition | AI Service for Image & Video Analysis | Leveraged for its powerful, pre-trained machine learning capabilities to accurately detect objects, scenes, and activities in images. |
| HTML/CSS/JS | Frontend Design | Standard web technologies for creating the user interface (`templates/index.html`) to interact with the application. |
| `requirements.txt` | Dependency Management | Ensures consistent environment setup across different development and deployment stages by specifying exact project dependencies. |
| `config.py` | Configuration Management | Centralizes application settings and environment-specific variables, including sensitive AWS credentials, for easy and secure management. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of DarshAI up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.8+**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **AWS Account**: An active AWS account is required to use S3 and Rekognition.
*   **AWS CLI & Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials with sufficient permissions (S3 `PutObject`, `GetObject`, `DeleteObject`, `Rekognition` `DetectLabels`) either via `~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables. Refer to the [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) for setup.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/Darsh-8-object-label-detection-ai-808d619.git
    cd Darsh-8-object-label-detection-ai-808d619
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Configure AWS (if not already done via CLI):**
    Ensure your `config.py` or environment variables are set up with your AWS region and credentials. DarshAI will automatically use credentials configured in your environment or `~/.aws/credentials`.

## üîß Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the DarshAI application.

1.  **Start the Flask Application:**
    Ensure your virtual environment is active.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The application will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2.  **Access the Web Interface:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the DarshAI dashboard (`index.html`). Here you can upload images, view detected labels, and manage your image collection.

3.  **Interact with API Endpoints (Example):**
    You can also interact with some backend functionalities via API calls. For instance, to get basic application statistics:
    ```bash
    curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/stats
    ```
    Further API interactions for searching or deleting images can be explored through the web interface or by inspecting network requests.
